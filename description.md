Baccarat Game 

Game Description:
Baccarat is a common casino card game where a banker and a player(not an actual person, to avoid confusion call him gameRobot)initially gets dealt 2 cards each (standard 52card deck).
The person playing (not gameRobot) can chose whether to bet on the player(gameRobot) or the banker. 
Whoever's cards total are closer to 9 wins. 
There are predetermined senarios where a 3rd card maybe be drawn for both sides the user has no control besides picking a side.
A = 1 facecards & 10  = 0 rest of the cards = their number value
if the total of your cards are  11 or greater than subtract 10 from your total. 
Again if you are playing the game you can choose whether you want to bet on the Banker or the Player(gameRobot)
The highest total any baccarat hand can have is nine.
A two-card total of nine cannot lose. 
An eight is the second-best hand. 
If either the player or the banker has a total of an 8 or a 9 they both stand. 
There is no exceptions and this rule overrides all other rules.
If both player(gameRobot) and bank are dealt identical hands, it is a a tie.
